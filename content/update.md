An update:

Went almost a week without watering.

Sun sugar branches started curling down.  Gave them some more water and are
looking good now.

Firework had a little bud cluster with about a dozen buds.  I clipped it off.
Firework looks great.

Sun gold with buds is starting to produce tomatoes.  Both sun golds are
looking pretty good with new growth.  Bottom branches don't look great, kind
of yellow.  Will probably prune them at next transplant.

Habeneros are looking good with good looking new growth at the top.

I think current water strategy will be every other day or every third day.
Especially dependent on how much time the spend outside.  More outside more
water.
