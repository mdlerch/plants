Some suggest to prune early buds off of the plants so that the energy goes
into producing roots rather than early fruit.  I am plucking buds on some
plants.  For the two sun sugars, I am plucking the buds on the plant whose tag
is turned inwards towards the plant.  For the jalepenos, I am plucking the
buds on all the plants besides the one that is closest to the tag.  I haven't
plucked any of the other plants yet.
